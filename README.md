# React Review App

This is a project from my bootcamp at Thinkful. it is what i made to get used to the basics of react.

It allows users to add, update and delete feedback. It uses a mock REST api with json-server.

Live Code: https://dazzling-swanson-3a91b4.netlify.app/

This project goes over all of the fundamentals of React...

- Components
- JSX
- Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc)
- State (Component & App Level)
- Styling
- Handling Events
- Lists & Keys
- Forms
- Context API
- HTTP Requests

# Usage

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
